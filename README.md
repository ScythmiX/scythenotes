# Particle Effects Notes App

**Skill Showcase Project** — This project is a portfolio piece, not meant for production.

A simple note-taking app that remembers your preferred theme, created notes, and edits. It features an ambient canvas background using plain JavaScript and the Canvas API.

The canvas is fully responsive to any screen size or window resize. It contains randomly moving particles that stay within the screen bounds. When particles come close to each other, they form a connection with a line, creating an interactive visual effect.

The whole project has a glowing theme and a modern look designed to appeal to the user's eye.
